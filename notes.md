# Object Oriented Programming Notes 1

**Object Oriented Programing is simulating logic in reality:**

For example, as a human,
we have **attributes** like weight, height, gender, hair color,
we have **methods** like eat, move, play, think
and we are all **objects** of a human **class**.

Conceptual Differentiation between Precedure-Oriented and Object-Oriented
**"OOP focuses on how to manipulate the data of the object rather than the logic required to manipulate them"**

Definition of an **object**: An identifier of a location of memory that contains a value,
or an instance of a class. It is a combination of data(fields) and functional code(methods). An object is an instance.

Definition of a **class**: An abstract description of all objects that can be made from this set class where an object can be instantiated from. Classes have attributes which devide into Fields and Methods

To define a class, use the **class** keyword
Code inside classes should be indented
To initialize Attributes, use the ```__init__``` thing
